# TypeScript Development Extension Pack

This exension pack is a currated list of all the extension you may need for Typescript development.

It is part of a larger series of extension packs. That you can choose from for your type of project or preference. In addition I recommend installing some extra tools to make life easier: [Development Tools Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MarkusFalk.development-tools-extension-pack)

It does not include any theming as this should be your personal preference.

I explicitly avoid adding snippets as there are so many and I don't want to force you to learn one or the other.
