# TypeScript Development Extension Pack

This exension pack is a currated list of all the extension you may need for Typescript development.

It is part of a larger series of extension packs. That you can choose from for your type of project or preference.

It does not include any theming as this should be your personal preference.

I explicitly avoid adding snippets as there are so many and I don't want to force you to learn one or the other.
